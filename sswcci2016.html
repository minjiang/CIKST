<span style="font-weight: bold;">Synopsis:<br>
<br>
</span>Effective transfer of knowledge would have significant
theoretical and practical values. For example, it could enable robots
to rapidly gain skills and adapt to new surroundings with relatively
low computational cost. However, the path to achieving this goal is
obstructed by a number of difficulties related to: computational
resource limitations, uncertainties of information acquisition, and
omnipresence of ambient noise. This special session aims at the
presentations of the latest research activities related to all facets
of knowledge and skills transfer, particularly from perspective of
computational intelligence and to applications for robots. The special
session is open to contributions on any topic directly or indirectly
related to computational intelligence in/for knowledge transfer and
skill transfer, touching on at least one of the issues mentioned above.
Submissions presenting empirical or mathematical results are especially
welcomed; but conceptually rigorous and innovative contributions of any
kind will be seriously considered, if relevant. <br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">The topics of interests in the special
session include, but are not limited to:</span><br>

<ul>

  <li>Theories or Applications of Lifelong Learning, Transfer Learning,
Meta-Learning Multitasking;</li>
  <li>Symbolic Knowledge Extraction form Deep Networks;</li>
  <li>Learning from Partial Observations for complex learning
environments; </li>
  <li>Multi/Many Objective Optimization; </li>
  <li>Cognitive Robotics, Developmental Robotics, Epigenetic Robotics,

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Important Dates:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

Paper Submission: 15 Jan, 2016.<br>

Paper acceptance notification: 15 Mar. 2016<br>

Final paper submission deadline: 15 April, 2016<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Paper Submission:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

You should follow the <a href="http://ieee-cis.org/conferences/cec2016/upload.php">IEEE
WCCI&nbsp; 2016 Submission Web Site</a> . Special session papers are
treated the same as regular conference papers. <br>
LaTeX and MS-Word Templates are available <a href="http://wcci2016.org/submission.php">HERE</a>.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Publication:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">The
special session is soliciting high quality papers of original research
and application papers that have not been published elsewhere and are
not under consideration for publication elsewhere. Manuscripts should
be prepared according to the standard format and page limit of regular
papers specified in the WCCI 2016 website. All papers will be
rigorously reviewed by at least two reviewers. <br>
<br>
This is a cross-disciplinary and CI applications Special Session.&nbsp;
Therefore, a submitted paper (if duly accepted and presented) will be
published under one of the three conference proceedings (IEEE CEC,
Fuzzy-IEEE, or IJCNN) that is most appropriate to the paper.&nbsp; Such
decision will be made by the Special Session Organizers in consultation
with the Special Session Chair and one of the three Conference Chairs.<br>
